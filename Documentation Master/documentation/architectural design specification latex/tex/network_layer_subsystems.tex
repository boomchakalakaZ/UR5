\subsection{Router}
The router is use as a mean of communication to the UR5.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The IP address is given and known to the UR5 through the polyscope.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The router gives an IP address that allow the software to send instructions to the UR5.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Interfaces}
There is two interfaces connecting to the router.
