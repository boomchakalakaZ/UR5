Ideally, our success criteria will be a successful and robust application of our \productname{} technology. However, due to time constraints and complex college schedules, we will be using the NASA (and Agile) approach to delivering this product successfully. 

Each increment of the product will accomplish a different task and yield a demonstrable product, each one building upon the previous. Even if the end goal product is not delivered, there will still be numerous smaller successes along the way, each with inherent and obvious value.

By the end of the project we will have produced an interface that can handle multiple applications. Whether the application of the product is great in magnitude will be left to the amount of available time to deliver.
