The \productname{} involves use of heat and moving components. Safety must be taken into consideration during the development of this project.

\subsection{Proximity Sensors}
\subsubsection{Description}
With moving components at play, it might be wise to install proximity sensors or at least a barrier to prevent a person from being struck with a moving component.
\subsubsection{Standards}
- Must prevent a person from being hit with the moving UR5.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Low. The UR5 moves slowly in its current state.



\subsection{Heat Safety}
\subsubsection{Description}
The UR5 will be interacting with a grill later in the project. We will need to ensure that our equipment is not damaged by the heat, and that we wear proper equipment to handle the heated components.
\subsubsection{Standards}
- Oven mitts must be worn when interacting with the grill. '
- The equipment must not be in close proximity to any heat sources, at least not for very long. 
\subsubsection{Priority}
High
