This section provides the reader with an overview of \productname{}, and the primary operational aspects of the product.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}

This product will cook grill cheese sandwiches on a griddle using vision processing, 3D Printed Mounts, the UR5 Robotic Arm, and a large griddle. You will be able to queue up jobs for the \productname{} for it to know when to start cooking. 

It will specifically have a webcam, and various 3D Printed attachments. External equipment may also be designed to make it more convenient for the robot to finish preparing the sandwich. 

\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
The product will receive basic instructions from a cashier, and also use a webcam to process where the sandwiches are. 

This webcam will allow it to instruct the UR5 to pick up sandwiches and move them onto the griddle. Once it is done cooking, it will move it to a "finished" zone, and display a message that the sandwich is done. 

(Currently the webcam is not fully integrated and movement is executed with a GUI.)

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
There is also a user interface designed to make it easy to queue up different features such as changing the amount of sandwiches to be made at once. 

Aside from that, the product will be fairly autonomous.
