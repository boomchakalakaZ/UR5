\subsection{Features \& Functions}

This product will cook hamburgers on the grill using vision processing, 3D Printed Mounts, and the UR5 Robotic Arm. You will be able to queue up jobs for the \productname{} for it to know when to start cooking. 

It will specifically have a webcam, and various 3D Printed attachments. External equipment may also be designed to make it more convenient for the robot to finish preparing the burger.
